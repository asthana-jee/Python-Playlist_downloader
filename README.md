# Python-Playlist_Downloader
## A python program to download playlists from YouTube that requires a good internet connectivity for faster download. 

### Prerequisites
PyTube should already be installed on your computer.
For more info check [PyTube Installation](https://pytube.io/en/latest/user/install.html)

### Steps ?

1. First copy the URL of Playlist you need to download and paste it in code as mentioned.
2. Run the program and let it do the remaining job :)

### Working
The program uses PyTube library to run. 
First it fetches every video's link and stores it in a list.
Then one by one downloads it.

==The program is not fast. I understand better code implementation is required. But this project was just to understand github.==
